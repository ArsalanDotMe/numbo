An app to help remember PIN numbers

So, recently I've been feeling overwhelmed by having to remember many different PIN codes and I thought it would be cool if I could associate a hard-to-forget image or phrase against a number. The idea is that you might forget the number but remember the associated mental image or phrase and then recover the number from there.

This project is an attempt to do exactly that. 


The app is currently hosted at:
https://numbo-pin.herokuapp.com/


If you write any 4 digit number in there, you will get some interesting word pairs that you can mentally associate with the number. These words might change on page refresh. I'm also adding some other cool features to it, like for example for some numbers, you might actually get the name of a famous person. Try 2745 for example.

The source data files are present in the assets directory.
